# Branch Development Workflow Rules

## Git Workflow Requirements
- You must always prefer to use branch development over working directly on main
- Before writing any code changes, you must create a feature branch to hold those changes

## Updating Merge.md
After you are done updating a feature branch - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file (or update the file if it exists) that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
